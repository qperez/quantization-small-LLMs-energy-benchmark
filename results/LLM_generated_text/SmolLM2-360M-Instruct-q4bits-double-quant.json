AI could be used to develop and deploy AI-powered chatbots to provide patients with 24/7 access to healthcare services. This could help reduce wait times and increase access to healthcare services for patients who may not have access to traditional healthcare facilities.\n\nSmolLM: Finally, AI could be used to improve healthcare delivery by implementing AI-powered predictive analytics in the supply chain. For instance, AI could be used to analyze data on supply chain bottlenecks to identify areas where supply chain disruptions are most likely to occur. This could help hospitals and healthcare providers to proactively respond to supply chain disruptions and reduce the impact of disruptions on their operations.\n\nSmolLM: These are just a few examples of how AI could be used to improve healthcare delivery.

However, technological progress is crucial, as it can lead to new job opportunities and create new industries.\n\nIn a world where automation is increasing, it's likely that job creation will become even more important. This is because automation is not replacing jobs, but rather augmenting them. For example, the rise of the Internet has created new jobs in the Internet and e-commerce industries, which were not available before.\n\nUltimately, I think it's a combination of job creation and technological progress that will be necessary to ensure a smooth transition. Both will have a positive impact on society, and it's difficult to imagine a world without them."

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.
