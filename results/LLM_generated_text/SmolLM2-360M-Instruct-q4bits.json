However, technological progress is crucial, as it drives innovation and creates new jobs.\n\nWhile it's true that automation is changing the job landscape, it's not necessarily true that job creation is the only thing that matters. Technology can create new jobs, but it can also displace workers, especially those in lower-skilled jobs.\n\nIn the end, I think it's a combination of both job creation and technological progress. Job creation is important because it ensures people have jobs and can earn a living. Technological progress is important because it drives innovation and creates new jobs.\n\nUltimately, I think it's a matter of finding a balance between job creation and technological progress.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models"
